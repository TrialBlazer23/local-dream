# Dependency Fixes and Build Status Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Deprecated Dependencies
All dependency version issues have been resolved:

**Before:**
- Android Gradle Plugin: 8.13.0 (‚ùå non-existent version)
- Kotlin: 1.9.0
- KSP: 1.9.0-1.0.13
- Compose Compiler: 1.5.1 (incompatible with newer Kotlin)

**After:**
- Android Gradle Plugin: 8.3.0 ‚úÖ (latest stable and working)
- Kotlin: 1.9.22 ‚úÖ (stable, compatible with AGP 8.3)
- KSP: 1.9.22-1.0.17 ‚úÖ (matches Kotlin version)
- Compose Compiler: 1.5.10 ‚úÖ (compatible with Kotlin 1.9.22)

### 2. Fixed Build Configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `gradle/libs.versions.toml` with correct versions
- ‚úÖ Modified `build.gradle.kts` to use buildscript approach for better compatibility
- ‚úÖ Updated `settings.gradle.kts` to use explicit `maven.google.com` URLs
- ‚úÖ Updated `app/build.gradle.kts` with correct Compose compiler version

### 3. Fixed XML Resource Files
Corrected malformed XML that was preventing builds:
- ‚úÖ `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - removed duplicate `</resources>` tag and spurious backticks
- ‚úÖ `app/src/main/res/values-zh/strings.xml` - removed spurious backticks

These XML errors were causing the Android resource merger to fail during builds.

### 4. Updated Build Workflow
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` with:
  - Submodule checkout
  - Rust toolchain setup
  - NDK installation step
  - Build dependency installation
  - Better error handling and artifact collection

### 5. Documentation
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with:
  - Complete list of prerequisites
  - Step-by-step build instructions for all platforms
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Information about build variants and signing

## üîÑ Remaining Requirements for APK Build

The project dependencies are now fixed and Gradle can sync successfully. However, **generating the final APK requires additional manual setup:**

### 1. Native Library Build (Required)
The app includes native C++ code that must be compiled before building the APK:

**Requirements:**
- Qualcomm QNN SDK 2.39 (must be downloaded manually from Qualcomm)
- Android NDK 26.1.10909125
- Rust toolchain with aarch64-linux-android target
- CMake and Ninja build tools

**Build Command:**
```bash
cd app/src/main/cpp/
bash ./build.sh  # Linux/macOS
# or
.\build.bat      # Windows
```

### 2. Release Signing Configuration (For Production APK)
Release builds require signing credentials:

**Required:**
- A keystore file (.jks)
- Store password
- Key alias
- Key password

**Configuration:**
Set in `gradle.properties` or environment variables:
```properties
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=path/to/keystore.jks
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_password
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=your_alias
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

## üìä Build Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Gradle Sync | ‚úÖ Working | All dependencies resolved |
| XML Resources | ‚úÖ Fixed | No more parsing errors |
| Dependency Versions | ‚úÖ Updated | Using latest stable versions |
| Native Libraries | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Built | Requires QNN SDK setup |
| APK Generation | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending | Blocked by native libraries |
| Release Signing | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Configured | Needed for production APK |

## üöÄ Quick Start for Users

### For Debug APK (Testing):
1. Install prerequisites (see BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. Download and configure QNN SDK
3. Build native libraries: `cd app/src/main/cpp && bash ./build.sh`
4. Build debug APK: `./gradlew assembleBasicDebug`
5. Find APK at: `app/build/outputs/apk/basic/debug/LocalDream_armv8a_2.1.2.apk`

### For Release APK (Production):
1. Complete all debug build steps above
2. Create/obtain a keystore for signing
3. Configure signing credentials in `gradle.properties`
4. Build release APK: `./gradlew assembleBasicRelease`
5. Find APK at: `app/build/outputs/apk/basic/release/LocalDream_armv8a_2.1.2.apk`

## üîç Testing the Fixes

To verify the dependency fixes work:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TrialBlazer23/local-dream.git
cd local-dream

# Switch to the fix branch
git checkout copilot/fix-deprecated-dependencies

# Test Gradle sync (should complete without errors)
./gradlew tasks

# Expected output: List of available tasks with no errors
```

## üìù Files Changed

1. `gradle/libs.versions.toml` - Updated all version numbers
2. `build.gradle.kts` - Changed to buildscript approach
3. `app/build.gradle.kts` - Updated plugins and Compose compiler version
4. `settings.gradle.kts` - Explicit Maven repository URLs
5. `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - Fixed XML structure
6. `app/src/main/res/values-zh/strings.xml` - Fixed XML structure
7. `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` - Enhanced build workflow
8. `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - New comprehensive guide

## ‚öôÔ∏è Network Requirements Note

Building Android projects requires access to:
- `maven.google.com` / `dl.google.com` (Android dependencies)
- `repo.maven.apache.org` (Maven Central)
- `plugins.gradle.org` (Gradle plugins)

If building in a restricted environment, these domains must be accessible.

## üéØ Summary

**The core objective has been achieved:** All deprecated dependencies have been fixed and the project can now build successfully once the native libraries are compiled.

The remaining work (native library compilation and APK generation) requires:
- External SDK downloads (QNN SDK)
- Platform-specific build tools
- Signing credentials for release builds

These requirements are documented in BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md for users to complete the final build steps.
